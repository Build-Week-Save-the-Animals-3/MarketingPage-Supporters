            <h3><a href="https://conserveturtles.org/">Sea Turtle Conservancy</a></h3> <br>
            <p>Over the course of nearly 60 years, Sea Turtle Conservancy’s 
                research programs have yielded much of what is now known about sea 
                turtles and the threats they face, and the organization is applying
                 this knowledge to carry out the world’s most successful sea turtle
                  protection and recovery programs.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://www.redpandanetwork.org/">Red Panda Network</a></h3> <br>
            <p>Red pandas are very important. As a flagship species for the vibrant 
                Eastern Himalayan forests, conserving them means habitat for many 
                species will be protected, as well as a landscape that supports over
                 500 million people!
                <br>
                The red panda is also endangered. There may be as few as 2,500 
                remaining in the wild.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://www.savetherhino.org/">Save The Rhino</a></h3> <br>
            <p>It’s shocking that today, three of the five species of rhino 
                are Critically Endangered, and two of them have fewer than 80 
                animals left in the wild.
                <br>
                The good news is that together we can stop poaching and habitat 
                loss so that in 20 years’ time, rhinos will no longer be near 
                extinction. But we need to act now.</p>

            <h3>Get Campaign Updates In Real Time</h3> <br>
            <p>The Key Conservation app was designed by a wildlife biologist
                 to help conservationists and their supporters connect on a 
                 deeper level for greater impact and change. We wanted to bring 
                 supporters onto the front lines of conservation in real-time so 
                 they could not only see the daily challenges conservationists face 
                 but have actionable steps to help make a difference.</p> <br>
            <p>The Funding feature allows supporters to see exactly what conservation 
                organizations need for issues happening in real-time. Each post will 
                have itemized requests from the field and supporters can choose what
                they would like to give funds to. Supporters also have the option to 
                give unrestricted funding so the organization can use it to pay for 
                critical needs like salaries, travel, longterm goals and more. With 
                each contribution supporters to send messages of encouragement to 
                conservationists in the field! </p>

                <p>¡VIVA Vaquita! is a coalition of like-minded scientists,
                     educators, and conservationists, who strive to increase the
                      attention given to the vaquita, the World's most endangered
                      rine mammal species. Our goals and mission are to generate 
                      awareness of the vaquita and to promote a healthy Upper Gulf 
                      of California ecosystem. We conduct research, public awareness
                       and education activities to bring this about. Ultimately, we
                        aim to help save the vaquita from extinction, and to do so 
                        in a way that also provides long-term benefits to the 
                        fisherman and other residents who live around the Gulf of 
                        California, Mexico. <br> Now, more than ever, your help is 
                        needed to save the vaquita from extinction. </p>
